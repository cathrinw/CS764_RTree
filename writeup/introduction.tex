In \cite{DBLP:conf/sigmod/Guttman84}, Guttman proposes the R-Tree, an index structure for performing range queries on spatial data efficiently. The paper gives detailed descriptions of structure layout and algorithms needed for inserting, deleting, and searching data. 

In this report we present results and discussion of similar experiments run on our implementation of the R-Tree structure and compare experimental results to Guttman's original results.
