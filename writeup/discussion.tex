Even after almost 30 years, many of the original R-Tree paper's hypotheses still hold true today. The ones we were not able to empirically support, even though mathematically they make sense, are those concerning significant insert/delete operation differences between linear and quadratic algorithms, search performance over different numbers of records. The former is most likely due to implementation differences and significant improvements in computer hardware: at small scale quadratic vs. linear runtime does not matter as much anymore. The latter, as explained in the previous section, may be due to a flaw in the experimental description in the original paper. Overall, we observed very little difference between the two very different data sets we tested.
